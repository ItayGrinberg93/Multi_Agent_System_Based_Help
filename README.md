### 1. Introduction
The proposed project focuses on heterogeneous teams of autonomous robots.This project originated from Cyton 300 gamma [Robotic arm - Pick & Place project](http://new.robai.com/assets/Cyton-Gamma-300-Arm-Specifications_2014.pdf)

which, in turn is based on the [Turtlebot3 - Burger](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/)  .

##### Objective
In order to collaborate effectively, AI agents must be able to reason about the behaviors of other agents, learn to communicate effectively, learn to ask for help from other agents and understand how they can offer valuable assistance to other agents. . 

The objective is to find methods that allow the robots to compute behaviors that maximize their `helpfulness' to other robots while complying with their own resources and objectives.

This is a challenging problem since it requires an online analysis of the current setting and the current capabilities of each agent, an online computation of an optimal policy for each agent, and a way for the agents to monitor and coordinate their progress.In addition, it requires an integration of high-level task planning and low-level motion planning in a multi-agent setting.  

Within the context of this project, a single *task* cycle can be divided into the following tasks:

* Identify the target object on the area
* Plan and perform a clean movement towards the object
* Efficiently grasp/pick the target object without disturbing other objects
* Plan and perform a clean movement towards the drop-off site
* Efficiently stow/place the object at the drop-off site
* If possible back to 1. Else ask for help and countine.
* Plan and perform movement to the object the first agent can't reach
* attach the object
* Plan and perform a clean movement towards the pick-up point
* detach the object
* movefrom the area


##### Relevance
Collaborative ability can be beneficial in several ways: Performing complex tasks that can't be done by one agent alone. Additionally, information sharing should occur and maximize the utilization of each agent's abilities, whether together or individually. Furthermore, when dealing with an environment involving people, we can define roles for the robot and the person.

Robotic manipulators and Differential Drive Robot like Tb3 have become ubiquitous in almost every industry; from food, beverage, shipping and packaging to manufacturing, foundry and space:

* Palletizing food in a bakery
* Serving food
* Precision painting of automobiles and aircrafts
* Targeting products to their packaging stations in a warehouse

These jobs all require the same set of core capabilities, namely, the robotic arm's end-effector being able to reach specific coordinates within its workspace, and the TB3 can navigate to a point in the environment at the location.
